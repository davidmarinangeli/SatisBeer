    <string name="beer_description_text">An Imperial Black Belgian Ale aged in old Invergordon Scotch whisky barrels with mountains of raspberries, tayberries and blackberries in each cask. Decadent but light and dry, this beer would make a fantastic base for ageing on pretty much any dark fruit - we used raspberries, tayberries and blackberries beause they were local.</string>
